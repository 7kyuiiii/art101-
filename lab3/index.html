			<h1>Lab 3 - File Structure</h1>
            <p> The idea of this lab was to futher create a local file structure
				 on my computer and add index.html files. </p>
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>It was easy creating the file structure 
						but is confusing to deal with some detailed things</p>
					<h2>Result</h2>
					<p>By reading the instruction very casrefully 
						it helps me to solve these detailed problems </p>
